<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>SDSC Image Library</H1>

<P>The <A HREF="image_types.html">image structure</A> used by MPEGelib
is the same as the one used in SDSC's Image Library so I thought it
deserved a mention here. It's a library which will allow you to
read/write 32 different image types and also contains functions to
manipulate them. it is very powerful indeed. Since version 3 you have
been able to ftp the source code as well as pre compiled binaries so
check out the ftp site at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/sdsc/graphics/">ftp://ftp.sdsc.edu/pub/sdsc/graphics/</A></P>

<P>I have received permission from SDSC to include some of their
header files in my distribution so you don't actually need the library
to use MPEGelib</P>

<P>This permission to use the SDSC code only holds if the software
produced is in the public domain, so if you are developing a
commercial product then you'll need to have a word with them</P>
