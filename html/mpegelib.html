<H2>About the library</h2>

<P>MPEGe lib is a library designed to allow you to create MPEG
movies from your application. It is really easy to use and
hides a lot of the complexities of MPEG streams from the user
(although lots of options are available to be changed).
</P>

<P>The encoder library uses the <A
HREF="http://www-plateau.cs.berkeley.edu/mpeg/mpeg_encode.html">Berkeley
MPEG encoder</A> engine to do all the complicated MPEG stuff. so
remember full credit for the nifty things should goto its authors</P>

<h2>Using the Library</H2>

<P>About the most complicated thing you are going to have to do to use
the library is work out what the format of your input images are going
to be. Once you have done this the library consists of 3 simple
functions

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="MPEGe_open.html">MPEGe_open</A> for initialising the encoder
  <LI><A HREF="MPEGe_image.html">MPEGe_image</A> called each time you
  want to add a frame to the sequence
  <LI><A HREF="MPEGe_close.html">MPEGe_close</A> called to end the
  MPEG sequence
</UL>

<P>At the moment the library can only make 1 MPEG movie at a time (if
you want more go and write your own library eh?). Also at the moment
it can only make one mpeg movie per session (although I hope to fix
this in future releases)</P>

<P>Once the library is compiled and installed you simply need to
compile your apps with the <tt>-lmpege</tt> flag and <I>tah dah</I>
instant MPEG's.  I have written a <A HREF="install.html">page</A>
describing the compilation and installation process. There's also a
page describing the <A HREF="example.html">example app.</A> you get
with MPEGelib to make MPEG movies from some sample PPM images</P>

<P><B>IMPORTANT:</B> before you decide you want MPEGelib please read
this important <A HREF="copyright.html">copyright notice</A>.</P>

<P>I realise my html style is not perfect and links my not be natural
for all you folk, so for all you types I have a file listing all the
HTML files below this one (just to make sure you didn't miss
anything!). It's sorted in last modified order and it called <A HREF="whatsnew.html">whatsnew</A></P>

<H2>Other MPEG stuff</H2>

<P>As I mentioned before <B>MPEGelib</B> is based upon the Berkeley
parallel MPEG encoder (although the library is in no way
parallel). The choice for using this encoder was easy to make. The
Berkeley encoder is extremely well written and support from Berkeley
has been excellent throughout the development of this library. You may
or may not be aware of an <A
HREF="http://www.mni.mcgill.ca/~greg/mpeg.html">MPEG decoding
library</A> (the reason mine is not called simply MPEGlib). This too
was based on code from Berkeley, the <A

Berkeley MPEG decoder</A>.
