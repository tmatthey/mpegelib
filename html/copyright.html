<P>This means that if my code wipes all your files then tough
(although I don't yet have a rm-rf function :-)</P>

<P>If there is any code written by me that doesn't contain this in the
distribution then it should and I accept no responsibility or
liability for anything :-)</P>

<P>Also you do not have permission to redistribute the library (at
this early stage anyway) if you would like to use this library for a
serious use then please <A HREF="mailto:alex@ed.ac.uk">mail me</a></P>

<P>At the moment MPEGelib is only available from me (via mail) as I
want to keep accounts of who has it. While it is in this state you do
not have permission to redistribute it and all modifications, must be
commented and I must be notified (so I can make sure everyone has the
same copy)</P>
