<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Image Types</H1>

<P>It would be impossible for me to guess every way that you lot
store images in your applications. It would also be unreasonable for
me to expect you to give me your images in a way which suited me. So as
a solution to this problem I have used a solution used by the SDSC
Image Library. You do not need this library to use MPEGelib, but it's
certainly worth looking at.</P>

<P>The structure that is passed to <A
HREF="MPEGe_frame.html">MPEGe_image</A> looks like this</P>
<pre>
typedef struct ImVfb
{
  int    vfb_width;     <I>/* # cols                                    */</I>
  int    vfb_height;    <I>/* # rows                                    */</I>
  int    vfb_fields;    <I>/* mask specifying what is in each pixel     */</I>
  int    vfb_nbytes;    <I>/* # bytes per pixel                         */</I>
  ImClt  *vfb_clt;      <I>/* points to attached CLT, if any            */</I>
  int    vfb_roff;      <I>/* offset (in bytes) to reach red            */</I>
  int    vfb_goff;      <I>/* green                                     */</I>
  int    vfb_boff;      <I>/* blue                                      */</I>
  int    vfb_aoff;      <I>/* alpha-value                               */</I>
  int    vfb_i8off;     <I>/* color index                               */</I>
  int    vfb_wpoff;     <I>/* write protect offset                      */</I>
  int    vfb_i16off;    <I>/* color index                               */</I>
  int    vfb_zoff;      <I>/* z-value                                   */</I>
  int    vfb_moff;      <I>/* mono                                      */</I>
  int    vfb_fpoff;     <I>/* floating point                            */</I>
  int    vfb_ioff;      <I>/* integer                                   */</I>
  ImVfbPtr vfb_pfirst;  <I>/* points to first pixel                     */</I>
  ImVfbPtr vfb_plast;   <I>/* points to last pixel                      */</I>
} ImVfb;
</pre>

<P>I have found this structure very flexible for storing most internal
representations for images.</P>

<P>Basically what you have to do is set vfb_nbytes to the number of
bytes per pixel, set the width & height and then set the R G &amp; B
offsets</P>

<P>The offsets are now many bytes into the pixel the Red component is,
so if your image is stored as ARGB (alpha, red, green, blue) then
r_off=1 g_off=2 b_off=3.</P>

<P>when I was considering how to solve this problem I though about all
the following Image types. Although some of them cannot be described
in the ImVfb structure it would be very easy + quick to convert an
image of this type into one described by a ImVfb. I have marked the
types which cannot be described by an ImVfb</P>

<P>The possible image types I have thought of so far are
<UL>
  <LI TYPE=square>is there an Alpha bit there as well? (is it argb or rgba?)
  <LI TYPE=square>Is the ordering RGB or BGR
  <LI TYPE=disc><B>*</B> is the image 2D or 3D i.e. is it just one array, or
  an array or arrays
  <LI><B>*</B> Does it contain RGB values or does it contain all the red values
  then all the green then all the blue
  <LI><B>*</B> Is your image not even RGB it could be YUV
  <LI><B>*</B> You may have 3 arrays one for each R,G,B (or YUV) (these arrays
  might be 2D or 3D)
  <LI><B>*</B> Arghh I think I'm going mad with all these options!
</UL>

<P>trying to cope with all these formats would make the library slower
and more difficult to code :-) I may support YUV frames if anyone
suggests it?</P>

<P>The data given in the image is copied into MPEGelib's own data
space so you can set up the ImVfb and fill it up and send it off as many
times as you want</P>

<P>There is a useful function <TT><A
HREF="MPEGe_ImVfbAlloc.html">MPEGe_ImVfbAlloc</A></TT> to allow you to
allocate memory for an ImVfb</P>

<P>
