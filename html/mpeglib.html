<P>Here's a HTML version of the README provided with it. (I have made
slight alterations to create the right ftp links for you</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The MPEG decoding library</H1>
<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Version 1.0.1 - 13 September, 1994</H2>

<P>

<BR>
Front end &copy; 1994 Gregory P. Ward (greg@pet.mni.mcgill.ca)</p>

<P>The MPEG Library is a collection of C routines to decode MPEG movies
and dither them in a variety of colour schemes.  Most of the code in
the library comes directly from the Berkeley MPEG player, an
X11-specific implementation that works fine, but suffers from minimal
documentation and a lack of modularity.  A front end to the Berkeley
decoding engine was developed by Greg Ward at the Montreal
Neurological Institute in May/June 1994 to facilitate the development
of an MPEG player specifically for Silicon Graphics workstations; the
decoding engine together with the MNI front end constitute the MPEG
Library.</P>


<h3>AVAILABILITY</h3>

<P>The original Berkeley decoder is available as mpeg_play-2.0.tar.Z via
anonymous ftp from

<A HREF="ftp://mm-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/multimedia/mpeg/"
>ftp://ftp-mm.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/multimedia/mpeg/</A>.  There is also
a version with a Motif interface;
look for mpeg_play-src.tar.Z.  </P>

<P>Both the above-mentioned SGI-specific MPEG player (glmpeg_play) and
the MPEG Library itself are available from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.mni.mcgill.ca/pub/mpeg">ftp://ftp.mni.mcgill.ca/pub/mpeg</A>. </P>


<h3>CODE STRUCTURE</h3>


<P>A programmer wishing to write a basic MPEG-1 player should 1) include
the file mpeg.h to get some typedef's and function prototypes; 2) look
in the source file wrapper.c for documentation on the five functions
therein (OpenMPEG(), CloseMPEG(), RewindMPEG(), SetMPEGOption(), and
GetMPEGFrame ()); and 3) call only those five functions.  Enterprising
programmers may wish to dive into the other twenty-odd source files
comprising the Berkeley decoding engine.  (Note: the files globals.c
and globals.h are really part of the MNI front end, as they were not
part of the original Berkeley code.  However, most of the code and
variables in globals.c was simply moved from various other source
files, and should not be of interest to the outside world.)</P>

<P>For a very simple MPEG player that uses the SGI Graphics Library to
display frames (should be easily portable, since there are only a few
calls to GL), take a look at easympeg.c included with this
distribution.  I have also written a full-fledged MPEG player (with
frame-buffering, interactive controls, dynamic zooming, etc.)  called
glmpeg_play.  It is available via anonymous ftp as explained above.</P>

<h3>PORTABILITY</h3>


<P>The only ANSI vs K&amp;R issue I have attempted to deal with is function
prototypes.  Note that some compilers that are ANSI (in particular the
SGI compiler in its default, or ANSI + extensions, mode) do NOT define
__STDC__ even though they are ANSI compliant.  For these compilers,
you will have to add -D__STDC__ to the appropriate CFLAGS variable
in the Makefile.  If you are compiling with a K&amp;R compiler, this
shouldn't be a problem.</P>

<P>Anyone who has problems compiling the MPEG Library and/or linking it
with other software should contact me (<A HREF="mailto:greg@pet.mni.mcgill.ca">greg@pet.mni.mcgill.ca</A>).</P>


<h3>COMPLETE LACK OF WARRANTY</H3>


<P>This software is supplied without even the faintest shred of assurance
that it works in its entirety.  In particular, none of the dithering
options except full colour have been tested at all (except insofar as
they worked in the original Berkeley player); I've been too busy
getting a nice 24-bit movie player working to worry about dithering to
lesser video systems.  ;-)  If you want to use the other dithering
options, go right ahead, but be warned: it's anybody's guess what
format the data will be returned in (you'll probably have to look at
the code that does the actual dithering).  Also, the code has only
been compiled on SGI platforms running IRIX 4.0.[45] and 5.2.</P>

<P>Please drop me a line if you use the MPEG Library, either successfully
or not.  And if you use it unsuccessfully and find a nice, easy fix,
do please let me know about it!  My email address is
