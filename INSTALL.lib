This file tells you how to install MPEGelib

you might find the html version in ./html/install.html slightly more palatable

First of all you need Berkeley's mpeg_encode version 1.5b you should
be able to get this from either....

ftp://mm-ftp.cs.Berkeley.edu/
or
ftp://ftp.tardis.ed.ac.uk/users/ark/mpegelib/

uncompress & untar the distribution of mpeg_encode and edit the
Makefile to get it to compile.

Once compiled you have a lovely MPEG encoder to play around with.

now uncompress & untar the distribution of MPEGelib and copy all the
files in into the mpeg_encode directory (cp * ../mpeg_encode)

edit the makefile to make sure the install directories are right and
that if you need ranlib it's used

now type 

make -f Makefile.lib

This should work fine (if you did the config right for the first
section) if not mail me!

now if that worked then just type 
make -f Makefile.lib install
and it should put the header's in the right place

if you have any problems please read the HTML pages and if that fails
to help then please mail me at alex@ed.ac.uk

all comments and suggestions welcome!
